# üîç LinkedIn Job Trend Analysis (Web Scraping Project)

This project analyzes job demand trends by scraping LinkedIn job postings (or using sample/pre-saved HTML data) to extract information such as job titles, required skills, and locations. The results are visualized using heatmaps and skill-role matrices to help users understand which skills are in demand across various cities and roles.

> **Note:** Due to LinkedIn's Terms of Service, this project uses sample HTML data or public datasets to simulate job data scraping.
